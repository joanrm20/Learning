## JavaScript Design Patterns

Design Patterns examples based on **Learning JavaScript Design Patterns**, a book by **Addy Osmani**

## Main Goal

The main of this repo is just to have an easy access to a set of design patterns examples.

For now it will have just basic examples taken from the book, but in order to help the community and myself, I'll try to keep adding new examples of how they can be use in a more complex scenario.

** Probably the project structure will have to change.
